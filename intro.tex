\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Building takes an instrumental role in energy consumption and smartness of a
building has a large impact on its inhabitants. According to
statistics provided by US Department of Energy, more than 70\% of electricity
has been consumed by buildings every year \cite{doe_annual}. Recent efforts
have been poured into the awareness of
improving efficiency in quite a few facets, e.g., heating, ventilation, air
conditioning (HVAC) system \cite{erickson2009energy}\cite{gao2009selfprog},
lighting\cite{delaney2009eval}, IT (Information Technology) energy consumption management within
buildings\cite{agarwal2009augnet}\cite{agarwal2010sleep}, etc. Amongst the
overall energy usage of various aspects of buildings, the efficiency of HVAC
systems has a tremendous impact on energy consumption \cite{hobby2012analysis}.
On the contrary, some buildings utilizing scheduled-based
programmable thermostats may consume more energy than ones without using smart
devices, when actual occupancy deviates from the programmed schedule
\cite{bias1999elec}. Automatic thermostat control systems have been developed
in different approaches \cite{thomas2012intelligent}\cite{lu2012eval}, and
plenty of techniques are applied in the course of building the systems.

Detecting the occupancy (i.e. existence or number of residents) in a building or a
room has applications ranging from energy reduction to security monitoring. For
instance, occupancy detection is critical for energy and comfort management
system in a smart building~\cite{Nguyen2013Energy}.  Using the occupancy
information, HVAC and lighting can be automatically controlled to reduce energy
consumption while human comfortness is maintained. Energy consumption optimization can
achieve higher quality with knowledge of real-time building occupancy
\cite{majumdar2014energy}. Previous research shows that energy
can be saved by 28\% by automatically sensing occupancy and turning off HVAC
when a room or building is not occupied~\cite{Lu:SenSys10}.

Due to the importance of detecting building occupancy, many methods
have been proposed in the past. The most widely used method is by
means of motion detection (using different techniques such as infrared,
RF, sounds, vibrations magnetism etc), which can detect whether there is
person or not. But motion detection in general can not tell how many
persons in a room.  Other methods include passive infrared
sensors~\cite{Dodier2006Building}, wireless camera sensor network
\cite{erickson2009energy}, and applying sound level, case temperature,
carbon-dioxide ($CO_2$) and motion to estimate occupancy
number~\cite{Ekwevugbe2013Real}.  Preheat \cite{scott2011ctrl} built
rooms with active radio frequency identification (RFID) and sensors to
detect home occupancy. Mozer \cite{mozer1997neurothermostat} proposed
a neural network method by using the history data from embedded motion
sensors and active RFID to explore occupancy rate. Thermostat
\cite{lu2010smartthermostat} also devoted a similar approach through
the employment of magnetic reed switches and passive infrared sensors
to take control of the HVAC system in residential buildings. However, those methods are
more expensive for deployment as dedicated equipment is required.
For the work \cite{dong2014real}, it uses $CO_2$,
  motion, and acoustics to detect occupancy and achieves 92\%
  accuracy.  The work \cite{majumdar2014energy} uses $CO_2$ and motion
  sensors to build a probability model using history data of 3 months, which is
  used in energy-comfort optimization. A multiple sensor network
  method is proposed in \cite{yang2016review} for occupancy
  detection.

One viable and cost-efficient approach for the occupancy detection is
to leverage existing temperature sensors or temperature sensor
networks already deployed in many residual and commercial
buildings. As human being will lead to small disruptions or
perturbations of temperature in a room, temperature sensor information
can be analyzed to detect the occupancy and even the number of persons
without additional cost.
In this work, we propose a novel approach to detect occupancy based on
the temperature sensor information under specific conditions by
applying machine learning methods, while it does not require many
sensors to be installed in a certain building.  We generate the
mathematical models based on support vector regression (SVR) and
recurrent neural network (RNN) to detect occupancy with two sets of
features for different application situations.
Different from
  aftermentioned methods, we build a machine learning model for
  occupancy detection by carefully selecting some features including
  solar angle, indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, working
  time, and light energy. Comparing to the work \cite{dong2014real},
  our RNN method can achieve higher than 99\% accuracy using two or
  more hidden recurrent layers. Artificial neural network (ANN) is
  applied in occupation detection works \cite{lam2009occupancy} in a
  feed-forward manner, not capturing periodical patterns as using a
  recurrent neural network. The above works didn't take historical data into
  account, which is important in patterned (e.g.  weekly, seasonal) occupancy
  prediction. Other machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine
  (SVM) and hidden Markov model are also evaluated and 75\% estimation accuracy
  was achieved.

We remark that SVR and RNN methods are widely used in non-linear
  regression applications because of their good interpolation
  performance.  We started with SVR as it is a widely used traditional
  machine learning algorithm. Then we experimented the RNN network for the
  same problem as an RNN is able to efficiently capture
  frequency-domain characteristics in its recurrent neurons, modeling
  a non-linear dynamic system underlying, which is an advantage of
  being awareness of daily, weekly, and seasonal occupation patterns.
  As a result, we are able to compare the traditional machine learning
  algorithm with recent deep learning technique for our problem. The
  comparison indeed sheds some interesting lights on this problem for
  the two methods as discussed later.  It should be noted that
  other machine learning method such as logistic regression, multivariate
  adaptive regression splines, and long short term memory, can be used for
  occupancy detection for smart buildings as well.

The new approach is based on machine learning
  approaches in which thermal-related features including room
  temperature, ambient temperature, and other related heat sources for
  detecting the number of people in a room.  The experiments are
  conducted by using a building simulation program,
  EnergyPlus \cite{energyplus:2001vf}, from Department of Energy,
  which can model the various time-series inputs to a building such as
  ambient temperature, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning
  inputs, power consumption of electronic equipment, lighting, and
  number of occupants in a room, sampled in each hour and produce
  resulting temperature traces of zones (rooms).  Experimental
results with the SVR method show that the 4-feature model provides accurate
detection rate giving a 0.638 average error and 5.32\% error rate, and
the 5-feature model gives a 0.317 average error and 2.64\% error
rate. This indicates that SVR is a viable option for occupancy
detection.  In the RNN method, we apply the Elman's recurrent neural
network, which has local feedbacks in each hidden layer. We use a simple
formula to calculate layer numbers and sizes to configure RNN
to avoid overfitting and underfitting problems. The error
level, in terms of number of people can be as low as 0.0056 on average
and 0.288 at maximum considering ambient, room temperatures and HVAC
powers as detectable information. Without knowing HVAC powers, the
estimation error can still be 0.044 on average, and only 0.71\%
estimated points have errors greater than 0.5. Our study further shows
both methods can deliver similar accuracy in the occupancy
detection. But the SVR model is more stable for
  adding or removing features of the system, while the RNN method can
  deliver better accuracy when the features used in the model do not
  change a lot. Comparing to first-principle methods, SVR and
  RNN methods work in a black-box way, which reduces the efforts of
  explicitly building model of occupancy detection and deployment of sensor
  network, while good detection accuracy can still be achieved, as shown in the
  result section. Our major contributions are listed as
  following:
\begin{itemize}
\item We use thermal system consistency to detect occupancy using other
    thermal-related parameters acquired by existing sensors, which dramatically
    reduces the deployment effort, such as elimination of the requirement
    of infrared sensors.
\item We apply machine learning techniques, such as deep recurrent neural
    networks, to explore the possibility and accuracy of occupancy detection.
    This does not require explicit application-specific or building-specific
    modeling.
\item Two machine learning methods are thoroughly compared in terms of accuracy,
    using different feature sets, which highlights the importance of certain
    significant features, such as HVAC power consumption.
\item We use dynamic machine learning models (e.g. recurrent neural network
    instead of non-recurrent alternatives) such that periodical occupancy
    patterns can be taken into account.
\end{itemize}
